# About Me
<div style="text-align: justify">I am a Special Postdoctoral Researcher (SPDR) in Star and Planet Formation Laboratory, RIKEN Pioneering Research Institute. My research focuses on understanding the physical and chemical environment of star and planet formation. 
<!-- This exploration helps us uncover the origins of our solar system and, ultimately, our own beginnings.  -->
<!-- Specifically, I study protoplanetary disks using radio observations of various molecules, including complex organics.  -->
I use the observations from radio interferometers, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), to characterize the physical and chemical properties of protoplanetary disks - the brithplace of nascent planets.

<!-- I am currently involved in extensive international collaborations, including several ALMA Large Programs, as well as leading smaller collaborations.
