# About me
<div style="text-align: right">I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Tokyo. My research focuses on understanding the physical and chemical environment of star and planet formation. This exploration helps us uncover the origins of our solar system and, ultimately, our own beginnings. Specifically, I study protoplanetary disks, the immediate birthplace of planets, using radio observations of various molecules, including complex organics. I am currently involved in extensive international collaborations, including multiple Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Large Programs, as well as leading smaller collaborations. More infomation about my research can be found <a href="https://yyamato-as.github.io/website/research">here</a>. Please see <a href="https://yyamato-as.github.io/website/publications">here</a> for information about my papers</div>.
